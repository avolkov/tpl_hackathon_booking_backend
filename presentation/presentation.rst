Backend setup for resource booking
==================================

What I tried to accomplish is in addition to the proposed User interface for
booking I also wanted to provide database backend so the librarians can
manage resources like adding new library branches that provide digital hub
services or adding/removing/modifying available resources like 3D printers or
laptops.

Librarians are able to edit modify and verify bookings (events)
